#Question1:-
          Selection and summary statistics: We found the zip code with
          the highest average house price. What is the average house price of that zip code?
Answer:-
#follow the steps to find the answer=>
   
         high=sales[sales['zipcode'=='98178']]
         
         next find the mean i.e-obtaining the average of the house form zip
         
         high['price'].mean()
        2160606.5999999996
 
 
#Question 2:-
Filtering data: What fraction of the houses have living space between 2000 sq.ft. and 4000 sq.ft.?
-Answer:-
#Follow the bellow step to obtain the answer=
            
           in_range = sales[(sales['sqft_living']>=2000) & (sales['sqft_living']<=4000)]
             in_range
             len(in_range)  //finding the length of the range of data from 2000 to 4000
             len(sales) // from this data we obtain the total number of data 
             -next steps to find the fraction so, 
             devide i.e- new(here i'm choosing len(in_range) /old(here i'm choosing the len(sales)
             so,
             9221/21613
             after devide we obtained frac data as .42 i.e- 42%
             
 #Question 3
  #  Building a regression model with several more features: What is the difference in RMSE between the model trained with
       my_features and the one trained with advanced_features?
       
  -Answer:-
            # my_features = ['bedrooms', 'bathrooms', 'sqft_living', 'sqft_lot', 'floors', 'zipcode']
              
             # sales[my_features].show()
             # sales.show(view='BoxWhisker Plot', x='zipcode', y='price')
             
            next step to build the regression model:-
            
    # my_features_model = graphlab.linear_regression.create(train_data,target='price',features=my_features,validation_set=None)
             
      #  my_features_model.evaluate(test_data) 
      
      -now moved for advaced_features_model:-
      
# advanced_features = ['bedrooms', 'bathrooms', 'sqft_living', 'sqft_lot', 'floors',
                        'zipcode','condition', 'grade','waterfront','view','sqft_above','sqft_basement','yr_built',
                         'yr_renovated','lat','long','sqft_living15','sqft_lot15'] 
      
  #adv_features_model = graphlab.linear_regression.create(train_data,target='price',
                                                            features=advanced_features,validation_set=None)
                                                            
# adv_features_model.evaluate(test_data)        
{'max_error': 3556849.413858208, 'rmse': 156831.1168021901}
 so,finally difference is-
             :22711
