Quiz, 7 questions
1 point
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.The simple threshold classi�er for sentiment analysis
described in the video (check all that apply):

a) Must have pre-defined positive and negative attributes
b) Must either count attributes equally or pre-define weights on attributes
c) Defines a possibly non-linear decision boundary

solution:- b
-------------------------------------------------------------------
2. For a linear classifier classifying between “positive” 
   n and “negative” sentiment in a review x, Score(x) = 0 
   implies (check all that apply):

a) The review is very clearly “negative”
b) We are uncertain whether the review is “positive” or “negative”
c) We need to retrain our classifier because an error has occurred

solution:- b

---------------------------------------------------------------------
3. For which of the following datasets would a linear classifier perform perfectly?

solution:- b
 
------------------------------------------------------------------ 
4. True or false: High classification accuracy always indicates a good classifier.

a) True
b) False

solution:- False
-------------------------------------------------------------------
 
5.  True or false: For a classifier classifying between 5 classes, 
    there always exists a classifier with accuracy greater than 0.18.

a) True
b) False

solution:- true
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
6.True or false: A false negative is always worse than a false
positive.
a).True
b).False

solution:- false
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
7. Which of the following statements are true? (Check all that apply)

a) Test error tends to decrease with more training data until a point, and then does not change (i.e., curve flattens out)
b) Test error always goes to 0 with an unboundedly large training dataset
c) Test error is never a function of the amount of training data

solution:- a
